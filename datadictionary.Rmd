Using data from the Dallas Open Data portal this report is intended to summarize police incidents in the City of Dallas on a monthly basis.

Incident records from the Dallas Open Data portal currently exclude certain incident types (such as incidents involving juveniles) and may be subject to change over time.

In order to keep this report concise only a select number of incidents classified as "Group A" will be included.
